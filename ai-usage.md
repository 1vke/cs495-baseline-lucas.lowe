I used AI, specifically Google's Gemini LLM chat bot, to help me out with debugging and pointing out a problem.

I went looking on the web for the longest palindrome, which I copy and pasted into my test case. What I had failed to realize is that the string contained an em dash rather than a dash, breaking my utility function that I wrote. A quick paste of the traceback presented me with feedback that the string contained an em dash, not a dash. I face palmed and then replaced it with a dash.
