### What programming languages have you used?
A lot, some more frequently than others. I have used JavaScript, TypeScript, Swift, Kotlin, 
Objective-C, Java, Python, C#, PHP, HTML & CSS. I am most familiar with Swift and Kotlin at 
the moment.

### Did you code mostly in classes, internships, real jobs, or personal projects? Put example projects and what did you do.
I would say I wrote the most code in internships, real jobs, and personal projects.

As of right now, I am a part time software engineer for Sweetwater. I had an internship 
with Sweetwater this summer as well. Before that, I worked with the Digital Corps here at 
Ball State. In the past, I had two internships with a company called CP Handheld, although 
those were very much classes compared to hands on experience.

At Sweetwater, I helped further a rather large update to the customer facing Sweetwater 
retail iOS application. Currently, I am maintaining and updating the iOS application, 
furthering an update to our retail Android application, and supporting and updating our 
internal mobile and desktop software.

From my first semester up until the end of last semester, I worked with the Digital Corps. 
Most notably, I made the frontend web application for the new bus tracker that is located 
on MyBallState. Other than that, I either updated in-house or client websites or made new 
websites / web applications.

For a good personal project example, I wrote a shopify monitor that would scrape a JSON 
file from a desired shopify website, compare that with previously stored results and from 
there shoot out notifications when something would restock. I rented it to some people 
that I knew for a while before I stopped doing that, as I stopped being into sneaker 
reselling.

### What was the largest program/system youâ€™ve worked on?
For codebase size, I would definitely say one of our internal desktop applications at 
Sweetwater called OfficeLink. It is a huge application that supports a lot of critical 
business infrastructure. For userbase size, I would say the Sweetwater iOS app, as it has 
around 200,000 users per month.

### What do you feel most comfortable doing in code?
Frontend is really good for me, I am okay at doing backend. Generally, if it doesn't 
involve complicated math or logic, I am pretty good.

### What do you feel least comfortable doing?
Data sciency stuff, complicated math logic. I say this because I haven't taken any math 
classes past pre-calc, but if I work it out and implement the logic, I should be fine. It 
would definitely be the part with the most friction for me.
